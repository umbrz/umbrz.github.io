Hiya!

I'm an ML researcher with interests in themes like Causality, Representation Learning, Algorithmic Auditing and AI Policy to name a few.
My goal is to help build more equitable and reliable systems. I am also interested in the interaction of society with technology and to create sustainable and equitable policies that benefit the greater good.

I am currently working on problems that tackle fairness through robust representattion learning.
