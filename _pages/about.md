Hiya!

I’m a grad student at the Socially Embedded Machine Intelligence (SEMI) Lab at UWaterloo, where I am advised by [Prof Elliot Creager](https://ecreager.github.io). ML researcher with interests spanning Causality, Representation Learning, Algorithmic Auditing, and AI Policy. My goal is to help build equitable and reliable systems. I’m particularly passionate about exploring the interaction between society and technology and aim to create sustainable, inclusive policies that benefit the greater good.

Currently, I’m focused on tackling fairness challenges through robust representation learning. You can find my thoughts and other musings on my [substack](https://substack.com/profile/176371536-ambreesh-parthasarathy?r=2x095c&utm_campaign=profile&utm_medium=profile-page).
