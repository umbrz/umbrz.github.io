Hiya!

I’m a grad student at the Socially Embedded Machine Intelligence (SEMI) Lab at UWaterloo, where I am advised by [Prof. Elliot Creager](https://ecreager.github.io). Prior to this, I worked as a Post Baccalureate fellow at the [Centre for Responsible AI](https://cerai.iitm.ac.in) under the guidance of [Prof.  Balaraman Ravindran](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). As a researcher my interests span a diverse set of themes ranging from Causality and Interpretability to Algorithmic Auditing and AI Policy. 

At present, my research is motivated by the following questions:
  1. How do we identify, understand and mitigate any novel harms that might arise from the rapid adoption of AI technologies by institutions and individuals en-masse?
  2. Identifying and understanding the underlying structure of decision making in AI systems. Do these insights help us improve models (in the context of safety, reasoning, planning etc)? Could we leverage these abstractions to better evaluate systems?

Through answering these questions I hope to achieve my goal of helping build equitable and reliable systems, and to create sustainable and inclusive policies that benefit the greater good.

In a previous life, I wore many hats—musician, composer, consultant, and policy practitioner—before finding my way into the world of machine learning research. You can find a few artifacts of that time on the [extras](/extras/) page
