# Creative Works

Welcome to my creative corner! Here you'll find my musical compositions and writing that exist alongside my academic work.

## Music

Music has always been a passion of mine, serving as both a creative outlet and a way to explore different forms of expression. I enjoy composing and producing music across various genres, from electronic to acoustic arrangements.

Beyond academic writing, I enjoy creative writing and personal essays as forms of expression and storytelling.
